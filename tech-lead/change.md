* positive information makes us feel good so we seek it out
  * people listen to the positive information
  * people take in information that they want to hear more than information they don't want to hear
* negative information makes us feel bad so we try to avoid it
  * our ability to learn from bad news changes as we age
  * kids & teenages and people over the age of 40 are least likely to accurately learn from warnings
* instead of using warnings about bad things that can happen in the future, use 3 principle that really drive our mind & behavour
  * social incentives
    * highlighting what other people are doing
    * we are competitive and want to do better than other people
    * the human tendency is to seek progress
  * immediate rewards
    * we want to be successful in the future
  * progress monitoring
    * highlight the progress, not the decline (if you do X, you will get better at Y in the future)
* an example from an electricity bill - which aimed to encourage people to be more efficient with their energy usage
  * social incentives
    * a chart showing, throughout the year,
      * avergage energy usage of people in your neighbourhood
      * your energy usage
      * energy usage of your most efficient neighbour
    * you automatically want to improve towards that of your most efficient neighbour
  * immediate rewards
    * a smily face (you are doing good)
    * there is an apportunity to get a 2nd smiley face (an opportunity for progress)
  * progress monitoring
    * the chart shows your energy use throughout the year
    * gives a sense of control of your use of electricity
* give people a sense of control is a really important motivator
* fear induces inaction
* the thrill of a gain induces action
* try positive strategies rather than threats
