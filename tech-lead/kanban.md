# kanban

kanban is just a tool to help you manage your projects, to continually deliver value to your customers, using visualisation of work.

* you can have as many steps as you want
* you can call the steps what you want
* each step has an active and a done column (to specify what it means to be done)
  * optionally, add a trak column for things which as stuck/blocked 
* each step has a work in progress limit
  * low work in progress gives agility, the ability to switch and work on something else

## example steps
* backlog (feature list, prioritised, not all same size)
* breakdown (small steps, questions, specify)
* answer
* validate

## example steps - personal kanban (e.g. at home)
* backlog
* doing
* done

## other
* the scrum concept of time-boxing (sprints) is not used.
* the scrum concept of retrospectives is not used (because blockages are visible on a day-to-day basis)
  * periodic retrospectives could still have value
