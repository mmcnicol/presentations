# attention span

* focus takes effort
  * we only have a certain amount of cognative resources
* task switching
  * there is a switch cost
  * increases stress
* multitasking
  * we can't do 2 things that require effort at the same time
  * multitasking is not good for us
* the Zeigarnik effect states that people remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed ones.
  * once a task is complete we tend to forget about it
