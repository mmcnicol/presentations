# agile

core principles:
* focus on user needs
* deliver iteratively
* keep improving how your team works
* fail fast and learn quickly
* keep planning


A user story is an informal, general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user. Its purpose is to articulate how a software feature will provide value to the customer.

A user story is the smallest unit of work in an agile framework. It’s an end goal, not a feature, expressed from the software user’s perspective.

User stories are also the building blocks of larger agile frameworks like epics and initiatives. Epics are large work items broken down into a set of stories, and multiple epics comprise an initiative.


the 3 most popular agile methods:
* Scrum
* Kanban
* Lean


## Scrum

a highly structured model with clearly defined roles and responsibilities

can be particularly useful for traditionally structured organisations that are moving to agile

values:
* courage
* focus
* commitment
* respect
* openness

requires a Scrum Master

a Product Owner orders the work for a complex problem into a Product Backlog

the Scrum Team turns a selection of the work into an Increment of value during a Sprint

the Scrum Team and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust for the next Sprint

Scrum is founded on empiricism and lean thinking. Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is observed. Lean thinking reduces waste and focuses on the essentials.

Scrum employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and to control risk.

A Scrum Team is expected to adapt the moment it learns anything new through inspection.

Successful use of Scrum depends on people becoming more proficient with these five values:
* commitment
* focus
* openness
* respect
* courage

the empirical Scrum pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation come to life building trust.

Working in Sprints at a sustainable pace improves the Scrum Team’s focus and consistency.

The acronym INVEST helps to remember a widely accepted set of criteria, or checklist, to assess the quality of a user story.

A good user story should be:
* "I" ndependent (of all others)
* "N" egotiable (not a specific contract for features)
* "V" aluable (or vertical)
* "E" stimable (to a good approximation)
* "S" mall (so as to fit within an iteration)
* "T" estable (in principle, even if there isn’t a test for it yet)

### Roles

* Scrum Master
* Product Owner
* Developers

#### Developers
are always accountable for:
* Creating a plan for the Sprint, the Sprint Backlog;
* Instilling quality by adhering to a Definition of Done;
* Adapting their plan each day toward the Sprint Goal; and,
* Holding each other accountable as professionals.

#### Product Owner
is accountable for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Scrum Team.

is also accountable for effective Product Backlog management, which includes:
* Developing and explicitly communicating the Product Goal;
* Creating and clearly communicating Product Backlog items;
* Ordering Product Backlog items; and,
* Ensuring that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible and understood.

#### Scrum Master
is accountable for establishing Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide. 
is accountable for the Scrum Team’s effectiveness.
are true leaders who serve the Scrum Team and the larger organization.

The Scrum Master serves the Scrum Team in several ways, including:
* Coaching the team members in self-management and cross-functionality;
* Helping the Scrum Team focus on creating high-value Increments that meet the Definition of Done;
* Causing the removal of impediments to the Scrum Team’s progress; and,
* Ensuring that all Scrum events take place and are positive, productive, and kept within the timebox.

### Scrum events

* the sprint
* start of sprint planning
* daily scrum
* end of sprint review (demo)
* end of sprint retrospective

During the Sprint:
* No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal;
* Quality does not decrease;
* The Product Backlog is refined as needed; and,
* Scope may be clarified and renegotiated with the Product Owner as more is learned.

The purpose of the Daily Scrum is to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal

The purpose of the Sprint Review is to inspect the outcome of the Sprint and determine future adaptations.

The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness.

### Scrum Artifacts

* product backlog
* sprint backlog
* increment
* story


## Kanban

was inspired by production systems that focus on reducing waste and improving quality

is a way of visualising and improving your current working practices so that work flows through a system quickly.

a fast and smooth flow of work means you can:
* deliver value quickly and predictably
* get early feedback to find out whether your product or service is meeting user needs


## Lean

like Kanban, is adapted from lean manufacturing principles

The principles of Lean aim to help your team focus on:
* reducing waste
* delivering quickly
* learning and improving
* using evidence and data to make decisions
