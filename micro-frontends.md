# micro-frontends

* micro-frontends enable splitting of monolithic frontends into independent and smaller micro applications
* are concerned with the presentation layer of a modern web application
* enable the decomposition of the front-end into individual and semi-independent front-ends, separating the business logic from the frontend, and creating independent services that interact together
* provide the same benefits as microservices on the back end side


## benefits/pros
* for developers
  * can reduce the overall complexity of the frontend
  * can enable developers to quickly and effectively deliver value to customers
  * developer attention - work on smaller projects (reduce cognitive load, reduce build time)
* for production
  * reduce release size/risk - avoid releasing the whole app - release smaller things which reflect just what has changed


## issues/cons
* for developers
  * increased code duplication
  * increased overhead
  * requires careful planning
* for production
  * increased payload size of the application
  * more complexity for observability & monitoring
