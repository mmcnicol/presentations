# estimation

## estimates

an organisation runs on goals and commitments. it wants and needs both speed and predictability.

estimates help in project selection over a wider time frame. so the organisation can make rational economic decisions.

estimates are made with imperfect information. an estimate is a best guess, a forcast about the future, based on available information. your guess will often be wrong. 

a good estimate would minimise the difference between how long something should take, and how long it actually took.

if you give a single date estimate you are making a commitment, a promise. if you deliver late then you loose trust. 

any estimate is not treated as an estimate - it is treated as fact; an actual delivery date because a managers typical next step is to arrange the individually estimated project tasks onto a calendar using known resource (developer) availability, adding some contingency factor (e.g. 20%), which reveals the anticipated completion date which is passed to their manager and on up the organisational hierarchy.

an estimate is a deadline, a contract, which increases stress and leads to working at an unsustainable pace.

the only honest estimate is "I don't know". all estimates are lies.

an estimate should be:
* accurate - 100%
* precise - just the right amount.
* honest

any request for an estimate, especially for a large amount of work, should be answered with something like a three point—minimum, expected, maximum—answer. if that shape of answer, never mind the actual numbers, is not acceptable then you’ve learned that you weren’t being asked for an estimate in the first place.

can we get better at estimates?
* clearer requirements?
* compare against previous actuals? ...we are not using the same technology & frameworks that we did 5 years ago.
* less waste? e.g. wasted effort, scope change.
* fewer interruptions?
* less work in progress?

what are we estimating?
* from beginning to done (released)
* to implement the business requirements
* to meet non-business requirements... being well engineered (clean code, maintainable, robust, secure, performant)
* ancillary tasks: dev environment setup, task prioritisation, requirements clarification, team collaboration, giving progress updates, recording time spent on a task and adjusting time remaining, updating task status, refactoring code, code documentation, coding, unit testing, integration testing, issue investigation, code reviews, multiple manual releases to test environments, quality assurance, user acceptance testing, release checklists, pre-release meetings, handover documentation for other teams (e.g. operations).


## no estimates

this idea was encapsulated in the #NoEstimates hashtag on twitter.

in essence this means not trying to estimate the size of the work; we just make sure we slice work into a size that we can bite on and turn around quickly.

by doing the work, we discover what is required to do the work.
