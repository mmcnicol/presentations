## estimates

an organisation runs on goals and commitments. it wants and needs both speed and predictability.

estimates help in project selection over a wider time frame. so the organisation can make rational economic decisions.

estimates are made with imperfect information. an estimate is a best guess based on available information. your guess will often be wrong. 

if you give a single date estimate you are making a commitment, a promise. if you deliver late then you loose trust. 

a single date estimate is not treated as an estimate - it is treated as fact; an actual delivery date.

an estimate is a deadline, a contract, which increases stress.

an estimate should be:
* accurate - 100%
* precise - just the right amount.
* honest

"I don't know" is not acceptable.

any request for an estimate, especially for a large amount of work, should be answered with something like a three point—minimum, expected, maximum—answer. if that shape of answer, never mind the actual numbers, is not acceptable then you’ve learned that you weren’t being asked for an estimate in the first place.


## no estimates

this idea was encapsulated in the #NoEstimates hashtag on twitter.

in essence this means not trying to estimate the size of the work; we just make sure we slice work into a size that we can bite on and turn around quickly.
