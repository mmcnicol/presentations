## estimates

an organisation runs on goals and commitments. it wants and needs both speed and predictability.

estimates help in project selection over a wider time frame.

estimates are made with imperfect information.

if you give a single date estimate you are making a commitment, a promise. if you deliver late then you loose trust.

an estimate should be:
* accurate
* precise
* honest


## no estimates

this idea was encapsulated in the #NoEstimates hashtag on twitter.
