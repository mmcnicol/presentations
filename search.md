## elasticsearch

Elasticsearch is an open source distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine.

It allows you to store, search, and analyze big volumes of data quickly and in near real time. 

It is generally used as the underlying engine/technology that powers applications that have complex search features and requirements.

Elasticsearch uses standard RESTful APIs and JSON. 
You can interact with it using curl.
Other clients are availale e.g java, javascript (among others).

### basic concepts

Near Realtime (NRT)

Elasticsearch is a near real time search platform. What this means is there is a slight latency (normally one second) from the time you index a document until the time it becomes searchable.
