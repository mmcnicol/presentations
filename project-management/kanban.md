# kanban

kanban is just a tool to help you manage your projects, to continually deliver value to your customers, using visualisation of work.

* you can have as many steps as you want
* you can call the steps what you want
* each step has an active and a done column (to specify what it means to be done)
** optionally, add a trak column for things which as stuck/blocked 
* each step has a work in progress limit

## example steps
* backlog (feature list, prioritised, not all same size)
* breakdown (small steps, questions, specify)
* answer
* validate

## example steps - personal kanban (e.g. at home)
* backlog
* doing
* done
