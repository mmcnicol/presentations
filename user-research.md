# user research


## user needs

When designing a service, always start by learning about the people who will use it. If you don’t understand who they are or what they need from your service, you can’t build the right thing.

People and businesses use government services to help them get something done.

'User needs' are the needs that a user has of a service, and which that service must satisfy for the user to get the right outcome for them.

You must keep researching throughout each development phase to make sure your service continues to meet user needs.


## When to research

In the discovery phase, you should find out:
* who your likely users are and what they’re trying to do
* how they currently do it (for example, what services/apps they use)
* the problems or frustrations they experience
* what users need from your service to achieve their goal

In the alpha, beta and live phases, you should:
* improve your understanding of your users and their needs
* test design ideas and new features with likely users
* assess users' experience of your service, to make sure it meets their needs


## Validating user needs

Good user needs should:
* sound like something a real user might say
* be based on evidence from user research, not assumptions
* focus on the user's problem rather than possible solutions (for example, needing a reminder rather than needing an email or letter)
