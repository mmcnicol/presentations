# Optional

Java SE 8 introduces a new class called java.util.Optional

> public final class Optional<T>
> extends Object

> A container object which may or may not contain a non-null value. If a value is present, isPresent() will return true and get() will return the value.

> Additional methods that depend on the presence or absence of a contained value are provided, such as orElse() (return a default value if value not present) and ifPresent() (execute a block of code if the value is present).

> This is a value-based class; use of identity-sensitive operations (including reference equality (==), identity hash code, or synchronization) on instances of Optional may have unpredictable results and should be avoided.

> Since:
> 1.8
