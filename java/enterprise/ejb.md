# Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB)

2013: EJB 3.2 released (Java EE 7, JBoss EAP 7)

Types of Enterprise Beans:
* Session Beans
* Message Driven Beans

In case of Stateful beans, a new instance of the bean is returned every time a client performs a lookup. In case of Stateless beans, any one bean from the pool is returned.

## Session Beans

The lifecycle of a session bean instance is, naturally, managed by the EJB container. Depending on how theyâ€™re managed, sessions beans can be in either of the following states:
* Stateless
* Stateful
* Singelton

## Message Driven Beans

A message-driven bean or MDB is an enterprise bean that allows you to process messages asynchronously. This type of bean normally acts as a JMS message listener, which is similar to an event listener but receives JMS messages instead of events.

They are in many ways similar to a Stateless session bean but they are not invoked by a client. instead, they are event-driven.
