Java Logging API - Tutorial 

Note: This tutorial does not cover the other popular Java logging API's (Log4J, SLF4J, Apache Commons Logging, LogBack etc.). It only covers Java's built-in logging API, java.util.logging. 

The following lists the Log Levels in descending order:
* SEVERE (highest)
* WARNING
* INFO
* CONFIG
* FINE
* FINER
* FINEST

In addition to that you have also the levels OFF and ALL to turn the logging off or to log everything.
