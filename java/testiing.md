# testing (java specific)

## testing categories

* Unit: Unit Tests
* Integration: Integration Tests
* Service: Test on service layer (SOAP, REST)
* Functional: tests that want to guarantee the operation against different business rules (happy path, sad path and alternative flows)
* Non-functional tests: performance, load, security, usability, etc...
* Acceptance: acceptance testing (testing focus on the user perspective)

## unit testing

Unit tests to be non-JavaEE-container based


How just about everyone gets unit testing wrong
There's a sweet spot with unit testing -- and most dev teams are missing it

## integration testing

Integration tests to use a JavaEE-container, but the test code itself should not be container dependent;

The correct way to use integration tests in your build process
* defines unit tests vs integration tests


https://antoniogoncalves.org/2012/10/24/no-you-dont-need-to-mock-your-soap-web-service-to-test-it/
No, you donâ€™t need to mock your SOAP Web Service to test it
* mentions "integration testing with Arquillian"
* example of "Endpoint.publish()"
* test your SOAP Web Service inside the container and write an the integration test, using an in-memory web container.

Unit-Testing of Web-Services with JUnit - SOAP Services
* create a real SOAP Endpoint and uses remoting to access the WSDL and to invoke the service. 
* example of "Endpoint.publish()"

Integration Testing for Java EE. By Adam Bien
* Arquillian - an open source testing framework integrated as a JUnit TestRunner.
* Arquillian consists of a runner and container part.
* You have a full control over which classes are deployed and injected.
* Testing everything inside an embedded container is convenient but unproductive.
* Using an embedded container to test your business logic is not only unproductive, but it is also conceptually wrong. Unit tests should validate your business logic, not the container behavior.
* Only a fraction of all integration tests can be beneficially implemented with embeddable containers or test frameworks such as Arquillian. Although such tests represents only a fraction of the overall integration test base, these tests represent the ultimate killer use cases. Without an embeddable container, it is impossible to test infrastructure-dependent business logic without changing the integration environment or polluting the production code with test helpers.

## non-functional tests: performance

* minimise api response times
* minimise page/screen load times


## non-functional tests: load

* dev and test environments tend not to have production data volumes, and they tend to be downsized (less storage space, less memory)
* test against an anonymised copy of production data, if possible, else if it does not yet exist, production-equivalent data could be randomly generated.


## non-functional tests: security

* prevent unauthorised access.
* ensure authorised users only have access to permitted data and functionality.


## non-functional tests: usability

accessibility testing is a subset of usability testing. it is performed to ensure that the application being tested is usable by people with disabilities like hearing, color blindness, old age and other disadvantaged groups.
