* Since the WSDL describes the web service interface in a "contract-first" approach, our matching Java classes should always be based on the current state of the interface and, ideally, always be generated from it.
* Since the WSDL is thus the "truth", we do not want to check in any single JAXB-generated Java class in our versioning.
* For such a requirement, a Maven plug-in is recommended, which generates all the necessary bindings and Java classes in the Generate Sources phase - both for the technical as well as the subject-specific classes required for the web service.
