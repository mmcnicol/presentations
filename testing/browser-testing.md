## cypress.io
* Electron is the default browser.
* many browsers such as Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer are not currently supported.
* cypress supports both BDD (expect/should) and TDD (assert) style assertions.
* when running in interactive mode using "cypress open", cypress watches the filesystem for changes to your spec files. soon after adding or updating a test cypress will reload it and run all of the tests in that spec file.
* Cypress comes built in with the ability to stub and spy with cy.stub(), cy.spy() or modify your applicationâ€™s time with cy.clock() - which lets you manipulate Date, setTimeout, setInterval, amongst others.

```javascript
describe('...', function () {

  it('...', function () {
    //...
  })

  it.only('...', function () {
    //...
  })

})
```
