## services

### virtual machines
* create Linux and Windows virtual machines

### sql database
* fully managed relational cloud database
* ensure high availability with up to three hot replicas and built-in automatic failover

### functions
* process events with serverless code
* that scale to meet demand
* use the programming language of your choice
* [Work with Azure Functions Core Tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local#v2)
* [Create your first function with Java and Maven (Preview)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-first-java-maven)

### event grid
* get reliable event delivery at massive scale

### service bus
* reliable cloud messaging as a service (MaaS) and simple hybrid integration
* decouple your applications from each other
* distribute messages to multiple independent back-end systems


## app service
* create cloud apps using a fully managed platform
* build web, mobile and API apps
* use .NET, .NET Core, Java, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, Python and Docker
* [azure app service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/app-service/)

### web apps
* create and deploy web applications that scale
* built-in auto-scale and load balancing
* high availability with auto-patching
* use .NET, Java, Node.js, PHP and Python on Windows or .NET Core, Node.js, PHP or Ruby on Linux.
* schedule performance and quality tests with staging environments
* use deployment slots to swap staging to production in seconds, and roll back to previous versions without downtime.

### web app for containers
...

### web jobs
* enables you to run a program or script in the same context as a web app, API app, or mobile app.
* continuous and triggered
  * continuous: starts immediately when the WebJob is created. to keep the job from ending, the program or script typically does its work inside an endless loop.
  * triggered: starts only when triggered manually or on a schedule.
* the Azure WebJobs SDK can be used with WebJobs to simplify many programming tasks.


### mobile apps


### api apps
* build and consume APIs in the cloud using the language of your choice
* [azure api apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/app-service/api/)


## monitor
* azure Monitor provides detailed views of resource usage
* Application Insights provides deeper insights into your appâ€™s throughput, response times, memory and CPU utilisation, and error trends.
