# graphql

GraphQL is an open source data query and manipulation language, and a runtime for fulfilling queries with existing data. GraphQL was developed internally by Facebook in 2012 before being publicly released in 2015.

It provides a more efficient, powerful and flexible alternative to REST and ad-hoc web service architectures.

It allows clients to define the structure of the data required, and exactly the same structure of the data is returned from the server, therefore preventing excessively large amounts of data from being returned.
