# openehr

an open platform for patient-centred health data

based on a standard architecture for future-proof health information, openEHR offers a path from silos of data to longitudinal, patient-centred care, for life.

detailed clinical models built for and by healthcare and information professionals steer the software development.

openEHR fundamentally changes the way clinical systems are built.

freeing healthcare institutions from disconnected data silos and vendor lock-in, openEHR provides a product-independent, standards-based patient record, querying language and tools for on-site rapid application development.

this greatly reduces costs while providing out-of-the-box adaptability to changing needs.

## FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources)

the HL7® FHIR® standard defines how healthcare information can be exchanged between different computer systems regardless of how it is stored in those systems.
